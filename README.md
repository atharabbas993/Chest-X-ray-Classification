# Tuberculosis Chest X-ray Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of chest X-ray images to detect tuberculosis (TB). The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and consists of labeled X-ray images of patients with and without tuberculosis. The goal is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify X-ray images as either normal or tuberculosis-infected.

## Why This Project?
Tuberculosis is a serious infectious disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and preventing the spread of the disease. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing TB more efficiently and accurately.

## Use Case
- **Medical Imaging**: Automating the process of diagnosing TB using deep learning models.
- **AI in Healthcare**: Demonstrating how artificial intelligence can contribute to medical advancements.
- **Research and Development**: Providing a framework for further research in medical image classification.
- **Educational Purpose**: Helping students and professionals learn how to build and train CNN models for image classification.

## Key Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Downloading and processing TB chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measuring model accuracy, loss, and visualizing results.
- **Confusion Matrix and Reports**: Generating detailed classification reports for better understanding.

## How It Works
1. Load and prepare the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
3. Apply image augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
4. Build and train a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy, loss plots, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
6. Visualize key metrics to understand model performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used to assist in the early detection of tuberculosis. With further improvements and larger datasets, this approach can contribute to real-world applications in medical diagnostics.
